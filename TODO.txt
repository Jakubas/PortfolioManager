Add testing
Add logger
Some classes aren't using Spring's IOC container
General refactoring
 - such as relying on abstractions instead of concrete classes
 - some classes have multiple responsibilities
 - there are some lengthy methods in places that could be split up/extracted to classes
use Spring's TaskScheduler to schedule automatic daily updates for stock information and anything else that might need scheduling
make usage of parsing more abstract so that it can be switched out more easily if we have to move to different data source
more TODOs to surface as I dig deeper into my old project
